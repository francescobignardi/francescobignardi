<body><h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Francesco Bignardi! 👋🏻</h1>
<h2 align="center"> Junior Back-End Developer 💻</h2>

<p align="center"> Passionate about <b>informatics</b> since 1999 when I approached the first videogames of my life (Age of Empires II was THE first). 👾</p>

<p align="center">Since then my life took different paths, graduate in high school as <b>electrical engineering technician</b>, graduate at University of Bologna in <b>political, social and international sciences</b>. 🎓 </p>

<p align="center">I'm a huge music fan, and over the years I've enjoyed recording electric bass and electric guitar with <b>Pro Tools</b>, <b>Ableton</b> and <b>Garage Band</b>. 🎸</p>

<p align="center">At the end of 2022 I decided that 2023 would have been a year of <b>professional training</b> in informatics, and I leaved a permanent contract in order to do that. 💻</p>

<p align="center">I’ve chosen a 6 months full-time course at Develhope based on <b>Java</b>, <b>MySQL</b> and <b>Spring Boot</b>. With on-demand lessons in english and live lessons with italian tutors, classes with a maximum of 5 students, tons of exercises and 2 projects developed in <b>Agile/Scrum</b>, that was surely the best way to being introducted in the informatics world. 👨‍💻</p>

<p align="center">Graduated the 4th of august, the 25th of september I started <b>working</b> in a <b>software company</b> based in Carpi (MO). I learned so much in this 3 months experience, joining a group of work and helping the software to increase day by day its code coverage while doing <b>JUnit tests</b>. During this experience I worked with <b>Eclipse</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, <b>Spring</b>, <b>Hibernate</b>, <b>Maven</b>, <b>Ant</b>, <b>SquirrelDB</b>, <b>Google GWT</b>, <b>Tortoise Git</b>. 🧠</p>

<p align="center">Now I’m looking for a new company to work for, my priorities are : <b>investiments in professional training</b>, attention for <b>work-life balance</b> and empathic people around me. What I can give is my commitment, passion for informatics and for work, punctuality, accuracy and all my skills acquired in this great 2023. 💼</p>

<p align="center">Currently learning <b>C#</b> and <b>.NET</b> 👨‍💻 </p>
